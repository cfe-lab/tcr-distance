*__Note: Archived, this repo is for reference only. See [`bblab-server`](https://github.com/cfe-lab/bblab-server) for current implementation__*

This tool converts certain cellranger output csv files into a distance matrix file using [`tcr-dist`] which is compatible with the distance matrix visualizer. 

This tool can be accessed [`here`] at the BBLab-Wiki.
